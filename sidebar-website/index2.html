            <h3>What Is Java?</h3>


            <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now part of
                Oracle) and released in 1995. It’s known for its platform independence, thanks to the “write once, run
                anywhere” (WORA) philosophy, made possible by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java code is compiled into
                bytecode, which can run on any device that has a JVM, making it highly portable. <br> <br> Java is
                widely used for building large-scale applications and enterprise-level systems. It’s the backbone of
                many Android applications, web applications, backend servers, financial applications, and embedded
                systems. Its syntax is similar to C and C++, but Java is simpler to use and has automatic memory
                management (garbage collection), reducing the risk of memory leaks and improving developer productivity.
