            <h3>What Is PHP?</h3>


            <p>
                PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular, open-source scripting language primarily used for web
                development. Created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP was originally designed to handle dynamic content on
                websites and interact with databases, making it a core language for backend web development. PHP code is
                typically embedded within HTML, and it runs on the server-side, meaning that it executes on the web
                server before the HTML is sent to the user's browser. <br> <br>PHP is known for its simplicity,
                flexibility, and wide support among web hosting providers, making it an accessible choice for developers
                and small businesses. It powers many well-known web platforms and content management systems, such as
                WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, and is commonly used for building dynamic websites and applications.
