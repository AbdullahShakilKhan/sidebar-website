            <h3 >What Is Python?</h3>


            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and
                readability, making it ideal for both beginners and professionals. Created by Guido van Rossum
                and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes clean syntax and code readability, allowing
                developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to languages like C++ or Java. <br> <br>
                Python is versatile, supporting various programming paradigms such as object-oriented, procedural, and
                functional programming. Itâ€™s widely used across diverse fields, including web development, data science,
                artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing. Python has a vast
                standard library and a large community-contributed ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Django
                for web development, Pandas for data analysis, and TensorFlow for machine learning.
