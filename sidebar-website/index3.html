            <h3>What Is C#?</h3>


            <p>
                C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and
                released in 2000 as part of its .NET initiative. Designed to be simple, powerful, and type-safe, C#
                combines the best features of C++ and Java, along with unique enhancements to improve productivity and
                security. <br> <br> C# is primarily used for developing Windows applications, web applications,
                enterprise software, games (with Unity), and cloud-based services. It’s known for its seamless
                integration with Microsoft’s .NET framework, which provides a vast library of pre-built functionality
                for tasks like database access, web services, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
